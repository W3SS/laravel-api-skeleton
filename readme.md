# Laravel API Skeleton

> Awesome Laravel boilerplate to create APIs using many cool features and technologies

I like to change the default architecture of Laravel when I work wit it, and some weeks ago I saw
some videos in [CodeCasts](https://codecasts.com.br/) of a serie about **Advanced Laravel** using version 5.3 
and I loved the architecture that they built. So this project is inspired by [codecasts/laravel](https://github.com/codecasts/laravel) 
and all the credits must go to [Diego Hernandes](https://github.com/hernandev), [Vinicius Reis](https://github.com/vinicius73) and 
[FÃ¡bio Vedovelli](https://github.com/vedovelli). I only made some personal changes to their architecture and I'm sharing it because I think 
that this repo can help when you need to start a new project.
